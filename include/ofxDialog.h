/** @file ofxDialog.h

This file contains an optional suite which should be used to request an action to 
be called on the host UI thread. This may be used to popup a native OS dialog
from a host parameter changed action.

When a host uses a fullscreen window and is running the OFX plugins in another thread
it can lead to a lot of conflicts if that plugin will try to open its own window.

This suite provides the functionality for a plugin to request running its dialog
in the UI thread, or any other action that can only be executed in the UI thread,
and informing the host it will do this so it can take the appropriate
actions needed. (Like lowering its priority etc..)

/** @brief The name of the Dialog suite, used to fetch from a host via
    OfxHost::fetchSuite
 */
#define kOfxDialogSuite		"OfxDialogSuite"

/** @brief Action called after an instance has requested a 'Dialog'

The arguments to the action are...
  \arg handle - handle to the plug-in instance, cast to an
                \ref OfxImageEffectHandle
  \arg inArgs - has the following properties
              - kOfxPropInstanceData    - Pointer which was provided when the plugin requested the Dialog
  \arg outArgs - is redundant and set to null

   When the plugin receives this action it is thus safe to popup a dialog, or any other
   taks that should be executed by the plugin in the UI thread.
   It runs in the host's UI thread, which may differ from the main OFX processing thread.
   Plugin should return from this action when all Dialog interactions are done.
   At that point the host will continue again.
   The host will not send any other messages asynchronous to this one.

A plugin can return...
  - ::kOfxStatOK, the action was trapped and all was well
  - ::kOfxStatFailed, something went wrong, but no error code appropriate,
    the plugin should to post a message if possible.
